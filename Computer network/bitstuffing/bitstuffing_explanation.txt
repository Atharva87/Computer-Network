#include <stdio.h>: This line includes the standard input/output library, providing functions for input (e.g., scanf) and output (e.g., printf).


#include <string.h>: This line includes the string manipulation library, which provides functions for working with strings, such as strlen.


int main(): This is the main function, the entry point of the program.


char data[100], stuffedData[200];: Declares two character arrays, data and stuffedData. data is used to store the input data, and stuffedData is used to store the data after bit stuffing.


int i, count = 0, j = 0;: Declares integers i for loop control, count to keep track of consecutive '1's, and j to keep track of the index in the stuffedData array.


printf("Enter the data: ");: Prints a prompt asking the user to enter data.


scanf("%s", data);: Reads a string from the standard input (keyboard) and stores it in the data array.


for(i = 0; i < strlen(data); i++) {: A loop that iterates over each character in the data array.


if(data[i] == '1') {: Checks if the current character is '1'.


count++;: Increments the count of consecutive '1's.


stuffedData[j++] = data[i];: Copies the current character to the stuffedData array and increments the index j.


else {: If the current character is not '1'.


count = 0;: Resets the count to zero.


stuffedData[j++] = data[i];: Copies the current character to the stuffedData array and increments the index j.


if(count == 5) {: Checks if there are five consecutive '1's.


count = 0;: Resets the count to zero.


stuffedData[j++] = '0';: Inserts a '0' after five consecutive '1's.


stuffedData[j] = '\0';: Adds a null character at the end of the stuffedData array to mark the end of the string.


printf("Data after bit stuffing: %s\n", stuffedData);: Prints the data after bit stuffing.


return 0;: Indicates successful execution of the program.
